# SheCodes Basics Final Project: Penguins🐧!

Hey stranger!

Thanks for checking out my very first ever project. This was the final project I submited at the end of my first coding bootcamp.
The focus was very much more on getting comfy with baby steps in coding and developping some must have habits.

~ I simply chose penguins because at the time I was living in England and it was FREEZING! They felt like my spirit animals at the time ~

Well... Stay frosty❄️!
