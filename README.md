# SheCodes Basics Final Project: Penguins 🐧!

Hey stranger 👋🏾!

Thanks for checking out my very first ever project.

This was the final project I submited at the end of my first coding bootcamp.
The focus was all about getting comfy with the basics coding and developping some must have habits.

~ I simply chose penguins because at the time I was living in England and it was FREEZING!
They felt like my spirit animals at the time 🥲 ~

Well... Stay frosty ❄️!
